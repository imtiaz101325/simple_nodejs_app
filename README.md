# Simple Node.js App

A simple Api and web server using Node.js 

# Running locally

### Installing Node.js   

To run the app we need to install Node.js. Any latest stable version will do. We can install Node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If we already have Node installed(which might be an older version) that is needed for any other project then it is recommended to install node with NVM to manage different versions.

We can install NVM following the instructions found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

After installing Node please make sure that running `npm`  works.


### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### start app

```
npm start
```

The GraphQL endpoint should be available  at http://localhost:1234/graphql
